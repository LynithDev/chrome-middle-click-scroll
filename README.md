# Chrome Middle Click Scroll
This is a simple chrome extension that allows you to scroll in the selected scrollable container, by holding / clicking the middle mouse button and moving the mouse up and down. This functionality exists on Chrome for Windows, but not on Chrome for any other desktop platform such as Linux and MacOS (You can enable it via a launch argument, but it's not "safe" and has a banner on the top of the screen);

## Installation
1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/LynithDev/chrome-middle-click-scroll/releases).
2. Extract the zip file.
3. Open the extensions page in [Chrome](chrome://extensions).
4. Enable developer mode.
5. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extracted folder.
6. Reload any pages

## Functionality
I tried to replicate Firefox's middle click scroll functionality as closely as possible, which means that by holding the middle mouse button, the scrolling will last as long as you hold the button, and will stop when you release it. By clicking the middle mouse button, the scrolling will continue until you click the middle mouse button again.
